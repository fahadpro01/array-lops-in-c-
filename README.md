## Objective
- We want to build a program that will print out a 
list of our family members names and how they are 
related to us. We want to create a version of a family 
tree, but with code. 
- First we want to create two string arrays of the same 
size. One array will be for the names and the other will 
be for the relationship that we have with a family member. 
The size will be the number of family members you want to 
put in your program (everyone will have different sizes). 
- Now we need to fill up are arrays. Build your first 
‘for loop’ that has a starting point of 0, a condition 
that checks if your iterator is less than the size of 
your array, and have your iterator be updated by adding 1.
- Inside the loop we want to ask the user to enter a 
family members first name. Then have the user ‘cin’ 
the input into the array(names array) using the loops 
iterator as the index. Next ask the user for the relationship 
you have with the family member. ‘Cin’ the relationship status 
into the array(relationship array) using the loops iterator as the index. 
- After that loop is complete, create the same exact loop 
with the same values under the first loop. Inside the loop 
we will ‘cout’ the name of your family members and how they 
are related. Use the loops iterator for the indexes of the 
names and relationship arrays. Ex: arr1[ i ] << “ is my “ << arr2[ i ]; 
That should be all your need to do.
